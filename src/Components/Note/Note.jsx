         At first, we became so close in a very short time.
          <br />
           I saw many peoples who get close in very short time and also breaks up in short time.
          <br />
            But I want that our friendship stays strong and beautiful until our death.
          <br />
          I hope our friendship never breaks.❤️
        <br />

         Thank you for understanding me. I always make u feel annoyed. 
        <br />
         I always keep breaking ur nice expectations and make u sad. But after all, u jst forget the matter and keep ur pain hidden, jst to make me happy.
        <br />  
        <br />
        <br />
        Our friendship is just 6 months old but I hope it continues for 6 decades.🌸
        <br />
